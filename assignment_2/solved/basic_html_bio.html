        <div>Both defendants -- attorney Kenneth Chesebro and former Trump campaign attorney 
            Sidney Powell -- <br>had sought speedy trial demands as well as motions to sever their 
            cases from the other defendants, including from each other.
            The judge, however, said that severing them from each other would not be needed 
            to achieve a fair trial. Chesebro, Powell, and 17 others, including former President Donald Trump, 
            have pleaded not guilty to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts 
            to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. 
            The former president says his actions were not illegal and that the investigation is politically motivated. 
            Prosecutors told McAfee during the hearing that they expected the trial against the 19 defendants 
            would take four months -- not including jury selection -- and that the state plans to call over 150 witnesses.</div><br>
