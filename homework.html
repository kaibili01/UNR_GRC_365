            <P>Interface & Web Design: GRC 365 SECTION 1001
                Fall Semester 2022 M/W 1:00-3:45PM</h4></P><br>

            <h4>Your homework consist of a two step process: One is to follow your textbook's instructions on each chapter's assignment and the second is to create a repository where that assignment will reside.<br>
                
                This methodology will require that you become familiar with GitHub and the appropiate way to create repositories to store your content. I expect one repository per assignment because this will require<br> you to
                practice file managment and containment. 
                
                <p>Some assignments will be broken up into benchmarks and won't require you to create additional repos. Instead you will fullfill your assignments benchmark for the appropiate due date, and submit your<br> 
                   timely homework via canvas using a link to your homeworks repo. I will follow your submiteed link to verify if in fact you have fullfilled the requiremets for the assignent at that specific benchmark's due date.</p> 
                
                If necessary we will adapt and modify our methodology in order to accomodate the nature of each assignment. Its important that you understand that design is a fluid and flexible discipine, but this does not mean that it is without structure.
                The design cycle incorporates systems, rules, and techniques in order to achieve an objective. When these tactics no longer serve the purpose of the design strategy at large, then we evolve accordingly. Never without a plan or without a logical roadmap guiding our choices.
                Therefore there may be instances in which you might have to create and additional repository.<br><br>
                
                In this class we will discuss FTP (File Transfer Protocol) but we will not rely on this method to publish our websites.
                Hence why understading GitHub and the command line will be foundational to your growth as web designers/web developers.

                Bellow is a list of each homework assignemt according to learning guide as follows: you will perform the assignemts and create a public repo where we can view your work and link your assignemnt as they are due <br>
                on Canvas.
