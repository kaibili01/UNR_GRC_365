                <h4><q><em>I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it</q></em><h6>â€• Pablo Picasso</h6></h4>
                

            Your homework consists of a two-step process: One is to follow your textbook's instructions on each chapter's assignment and the second is to create a zip file that you will submit to canvas. <br>
                Additionally, you should do each assignment's chapter's exercises and activities to reinforce your learning of the material. I will be reproducing these exercises and activities as a means to 
                test<br> and quiz you in class thus ensuring that you are not simply regurgitating the content in the textbook, but that you actually comprehend it.  <br>
                
                <p>This methodology will require that you become familiar with file organization and that you correctly name your files. I expect one zip file per assignment; This will require you to practice<br> 
                    file management and containment. 
                
                    If necessary we will adapt and modify our methodology in order to accommodate the nature of each assignment. It's important that you understand that design is a<br>fluid and flexible discipline 
                    but this does not mean that it is without structure.
                </p>
                The design cycle incorporates systems, rules, and techniques in order to achieve an objective. When these tactics no longer serve the purpose of the design strategy at large, then we evolve accordingly.<br> 
                Never without a plan or without a logical roadmap guiding our choices. A prime example of this is how we had to adapt our method for submitting assignments and homework via compressed files<br> 
                instead of creating repos in GitHub.<br><br>
